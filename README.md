# Employee Leave & Attendance Management System (Mini HR Tool)

A full-stack HR management system that allows employees to mark attendance, apply for leave, and track history while enabling admins to manage employee attendance and approve/reject leave requests.

This project was developed as part of a Full-Stack Developer technical assignment to demonstrate backend business logic, authentication, role-based access control, and frontend integration.
